# Customer Churn Analysis & Prediction Pipeline

## Overview
This project is a complete end-to-end pipeline for customer churn analysis and prediction. It integrates customer segmentation using K-Means with PCA, predictive modeling with Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, and Stacking. The pipeline automatically generates a comprehensive report with visualizations, metrics, and insights.

## Features
- Data preprocessing and cleaning
- Customer segmentation using PCA + K-Means
- Predictive modeling for churn using multiple algorithms
- Model evaluation: Accuracy, AUC, F1-score, confusion matrix, cross-validation
- Automated generation of a PDF report with charts and metrics

## Technologies
- Python 3.x
- Pandas, NumPy
- Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Scikit-learn
- Imbalanced-learn (SMOTE)
- ReportLab (PDF report generation)

## Usage
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/churn-pipeline.git
